## Phase 1
For this first part of the class project, I used the flex tool to generate a lexical analyzer for a high-level source code language called "MINI-L". The lexical analyzer should take as input a MINI-L program, parse it, and output the sequence of lexical tokens associated with the program.

## Phase 2
In this phase of the class project, I created a parser using the bison tool that will check to see whether the identified sequence of tokens adheres to the specified grammar of MINI-L. The output of my parser will be the list of productions used during the parsing process. If any syntax errors are encountered during parsing, my parser emits appropriate error messages.

## Phase 3
